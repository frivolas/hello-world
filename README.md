# hello-world!

Being _this_ my very __first__ Git repository, I feel the compulsory need to write about how awesome and magnanimus __I__ am.

It is true that I'm neither awesome nor magnanimus, but as the say says, I'm _faking it until I'm making it_, and so with that it is my expectation that my previous paragraph left you aghast.

Mexican born and raised mechanical engineer, transplanted to the not-so-rusty-anymore land of Pittsburgh, the fort of Pit, wherer I learned how to do user research, concept development and product development to end up working for a robotics company that left me hanging at the end. Moved to the city of brotherly love, where I gladly didn't receive any love from any brother, and developed cutting-edge, never-commercialized, drug-delivery medical devices that are more easily understood if simply described as miniature, hand operated Rube Goldberg machines. In my pursue of the eternal love I ended up in New York City, The City that never sleeps but that closes every restaurant at 10pm. I now develop user experiences, do human factors on the side and dream of building robots while I look for a new job that will give me a fulfilling experience while allowing me to have only one job.

_Adios Amigos!_
